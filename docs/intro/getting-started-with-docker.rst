Getting Started with Docker
===========================

The simplest way to get started with Adnexus is to use Docker Compose to install all components
onto a single system, so that you can experience the functionality and quickly see
if ADNEXUS is right for your business.

.. note::
  All services are installed on a single machine in this installation method.  This
  is not recommended for production use - only for demonstration purposes.

This quickstart process performs the following tasks:

* Starts a complete RTB system, along with a campaign manager and reporting system.
* A demo campaign configuration is loaded and can be edited in the campaign manager.
* An SSP exchange simulator is started, sending bid requests to the system. This shows a working RTB application processing real bids.
* View how data flows through the system in real-time with the deployed reporting system.

Quick start
-----------

This quick start process will deploy a Docker swarm application.
You must have `Docker Compose installed on your system <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_ before you start.

Create the docker compose file. Edit a new file called docker-compose.yml, then add the following contents:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/docker-compose.yml
   :language: yaml

Build the project.  From the directory where you saved the docker-compose.yml file, run the following command:

.. prompt:: bash $

    docker-compose up -d

You should see containers starting each Adnexus component.

Looking around
--------------

To view each of the components running:

.. prompt:: bash $

    docker ps


To stop the containers:

.. prompt:: bash $

    docker-compose down


================  =====================  ==========
COMPONENT         LOCATION               LOGIN
================  =====================  ==========
Campaign Manager  http://localhost:8080  username:
                                         password:
MySQL Database
================  =====================  ==========

To view the containers:

.. prompt:: bash $

    docker stack ps adnexus

You should see the following response.

.. prompt:: bash $

    xxxx

After the system is started, you can try the following actions.

* Access the campaing manager by opening a browser to URL http://localhost:3000/. You can log in with user ID demo@ad.nexus, password adnexus.
	* View how a sample campaign is defined.
	* View how a sample creative is defined.
	* View how a sample target is defined.
	* View the sample reports dashboard.
	* Edit the sample campaigns.

* The application includes the ELK stack (http://elastic.co) for ingesting RTB log events.
	* You can access Kibana reporting system at URL http://localhost:5601.
	* On the discover screem, the index drop down will allow you to show requests, bid and wins processed by the bidder.
	* Build custom visualizations and dashboards using Kibana.

* Explore the internal works of the bidder by logging into the bidder console at http://localhost:8080/admin_login.
